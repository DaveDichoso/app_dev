My first repository
The Karate Kid Wiki is a collaborative database dedicated to documenting the heroics of legendary icon Daniel LaRusso and everyone's favorite mentor, Mr. Miyagi. This wiki includes detailed information regarding the original four films, spin-offs, additional merchandise, video games, locations, and more! Our goal is to have the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding The Karate Kid Universe.

In 2019, The Karate Kid Universe expanded with the YouTube Premium/Netflix original series, Cobra Kai. The series takes place 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, with the continuation of the inescapable conflict between Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence. The sixth and final season is coming soon to Netflix.
